# AI Lab

This AI Lab has three IoT Devices, one autonomous vehicle, and one data mart.  It was designed to teach youth about robotics and artificial intelligence, but adults like it too.

<h2>AstroPiQuake</h2>

AstroPiQuake is an environment sensor that can also detect earthquakes.  It is easy to build with snap together parts.
Try out the [AstroPiQuake emulator](https://trinket.io/python/9c2e984979).  Move the temperature slider to see Smiley's face change colors from cool blue to mellow yellow to red hot.  Build your own AstroPiQuake using these <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/AstroPiQuake">instructions</a>

<h2>Enviro</h2>
Enviro is an environment sensor that can also detect sky color to help forecast weather.  It is easy to build with snap together parts.
Build your own using these <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Enviro">instructions</a>

<h2>Air MacClean</h2>
Air MacClean is a CO2 and TVOC sensor.  To build it, you must solder and attach wires.  <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Air_MacClean">Here are the instructions</a>.

<h2>Bumblebee AV</h2>
Bumblebee AV is a simple autonomous vehicle.  There are many ways to build the vehicle.  These <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Bumblebee_AV">instructions</a> recommend LegosTM and robot parts.  The motor controller must be soldered and wires must be attached.  

<h2>Public Radio</h2>
Public radio is an Oracle VirtualBox running Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.x, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Folium, and Google TTS (text-to-speech) software.

<h2>MOBI Data Mart</h2>
The MOBI Data Mart is a simple marketplace for buying and selling data
