# AI Lab

This AI Lab has three IoT Devices, one autonomous vehicle, a "public radio", and a data mart.  It was designed to teach youth about robotics and artificial intelligence, but adults like it too.

<h2>AstroPiQuake</h2>

AstroPiQuake is an environment sensor that can also detect earthquakes.  It is easy to build with snap together parts.
Try out the [AstroPiQuake emulator](https://trinket.io/python/9c2e984979).  Move the temperature slider to see Smiley's face change colors from cool blue to mellow yellow to red hot. Follow these <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/AstroPiQuake">instructions</a> to build it

<h2>Enviro</h2>
Enviro is an environment sensor that can also detect sky color to help forecast weather.  To build it, you must solder and snap together parts.  Follow these <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Enviro">instructions</a>

<h2>Air MacClean</h2>
Air MacClean is a CO2 and TVOC sensor.  To build it, you must solder and attach wires.  Follow these <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Air_MacClean">instructions</a>.

<h2>Bumblebee AV</h2>
Bumblebee AV is a simple autonomous vehicle.  There are many ways to build the vehicle.  These <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Bumblebee_AV">instructions</a> recommend LegosTM and robot parts.  The motor controller must be soldered and wires, motors, and wheels must be attached.  I do not recommend using a three-wheel robot with a coaster wheel because it is difficult to control when turning left or right.  

<h2>Public Radio</h2>
Public radio runs on an Oracle VirtualBox loaded with the Ubuntu 18.04 operating system and the Python 3.x programming language with Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Folium, and Google TTS (text-to-speech) modules installed.

<h2>MOBI Data Mart</h2>
The MOBI Data Mart is a simple marketplace for buying and selling data.  You can replace this with a popular data marketplace.
